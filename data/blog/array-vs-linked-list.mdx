# Array vs Linked List

## Array

- Arrays are stored in contiguous memory locations.
- Arrays are indexed, so you can access any element in constant time.
- Arrays are fixed in size, so you can't add or remove elements without creating a new array.
- Arrays are not dynamic, so you have to know the size of the array before you create it.
- Arrays are not good for inserting or deleting elements, because you have to shift all the elements after the insertion or deletion.

## Linked List

- Linked lists are not stored in contiguous memory locations.
- Linked lists are not indexed, so you can't access any element in constant time.
- Linked lists are dynamic, so you can add or remove elements without creating a new list.
- Linked lists are not fixed in size, so you don't have to know the size of the list before you create it.
- Linked lists are good for inserting and deleting elements, because you don't have to shift all the elements after the insertion or deletion.
