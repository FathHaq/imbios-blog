summary: Cheap way to handle expensive operations in Next.js

React v16.8 introduced a new hook called `useEffect` which allows you to run side effects in your functional components. This is a great way to handle expensive operations like API calls, but it can be a bit tricky to get right. In this post, I'll show you how to use `useEffect` to debounce expensive operations in Next.js.

## What is debouncing?

Debouncing is a technique for controlling the rate at which a function is called. It's useful when you have an expensive operation that you want to run only when the user has stopped typing, for example. In this case, you can debounce the API call so that it's only made when the user has stopped typing for a certain amount of time.

## useEffect

`useEffect` is a hook that allows you to run side effects in your functional components. It's similar to `componentDidMount` and `componentDidUpdate` in class components. The first argument is a function that will be called when the component mounts or updates. The second argument is an array of dependencies. If the dependencies change, the function will be called again. If the array is empty, the function will only be called when the component mounts.

```jsx
import React, { useEffect } from 'react'

const MyComponent = () => {
  useEffect(() => {
    console.log('This will be called when the component mounts')
  }, [])

  useEffect(() => {
    console.log('This will be called when the component mounts and when the dependencies change')
  }, [dependency1, dependency2])

  return <div>Hello world</div>
}
```

## How to debounce in Next.js

The first thing you need to do is create a custom hook that will handle the debouncing. Here's a simple example:

```js
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react'

export default function useDebounce(value, delay) {
  const [debouncedValue, setDebouncedValue] = useState(value)

  useEffect(() => {
    const handler = setTimeout(() => {
      setDebouncedValue(value)
    }, delay)

    return () => {
      clearTimeout(handler)
    }
  }, [value, delay])

  return debouncedValue
}
```

This hook takes two arguments: the value to debounce and the delay in milliseconds. It returns the debounced value. The hook uses `useEffect` to set a timeout that will update the debounced value after the specified delay. It also returns a cleanup function that will clear the timeout if the value or delay changes.

Now that we have a hook that can debounce values, we can use it to debounce API calls. Here's an example:

```js
import useDebounce from './useDebounce'

export default function Search() {
  const [search, setSearch] = useState('')
  const debouncedSearch = useDebounce(search, 500)

  useEffect(() => {
    if (debouncedSearch) {
      fetch(`/api/search?q=${debouncedSearch}`)
    }
  }, [debouncedSearch])

  return <input type="text" value={search} onChange={(e) => setSearch(e.target.value)} />
}
```

This component will make an API call to `/api/search` whenever the user stops typing for 500 milliseconds. The API call will be made with the value of the input field as the query string.

## Performance

Debouncing is a cheap way to handle expensive operations in Next.js. It's a lot cheaper than using a library like `lodash.debounce` because it doesn't require any extra dependencies. It's also a lot cheaper than using a library like `react-throttle` because it doesn't require any extra code to be bundled.

## Conclusion

Debouncing is a useful technique for controlling the rate at which a function is called. It's especially useful when you have an expensive operation that you want to run only when the user has stopped typing.
