## What I built

Cardus is a web app that allows users to create and manage their own warehouse of items. Users can add items to their warehouse, and easily identify what box is storing what item. Users can also share their warehouse or box with other users, allowing them to collaborate together.

### Description

Cardus App is a web app project to challange the boundry of web development for mobile user. The app is built with Next.js, a React framework, and deployed on Vercel. The app is also a PWA, which means it can be installed on mobile devices. The app also uses Trusted Web Activity, which allows the app to be installed on Android devices. The app also uses Google Cloud Platform to store images, and to run TensorFlow.js models to auto detect objects in item images.

I want the app to be seamlessly like native app, there are onboarding screen, beautiful transition, and smooth animations. The app also has a dark mode, which is a must for any modern app.
